First, and foremost, please read below.

We are currently doing reforms in the tap trying to improve and make it easier to use it. Our main aim is to generate a QGIS formula that will install a complete QGIS with all the standard plugging, plus some additions, without the need by the end user to build it in their local machine.

Not to mention that we are running into some trouble at the moment and we are probably going to make you run in some too. We apologize for all the problems and we hope in the following weeks everything go to normal.
